      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">TRY HARD</h2>
      <h2 class="w3-wide">1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">a. Project Title:<br>
Try Hard 
b. Project Definiton:<br>
Our project is a mobile game that tests players skills in various ways such as speed, memory, caution, intelligence. The game has different categories for each skill. It is available for all devices that supports android 4.0 or higher. There is an interface that allows to see other player's activities.<br> 
c. Project Goal:<br>
The game aims to improve basic skills of players. So that they can use their skills in anywhere in their life.<br> 
d. Project Scope:<br>
In this project we've tried to spread our workforce on an equal weekly basis. We finished our project in eight weeks with constant progress logic, also most importantly we’ve completed every tasks on the requirements list in this eight week period. As a result of our efficient work, we designed a game that our users could enjoy and think while playing. Try Hard’s one of the main goal is that being a game that could improve users by forcing their basic brain functions. We had it and will improve our game until we achieve this task.<br> 
e. Application Areas:<br> 
Our project is a game, so our application area is users who play our game. But unlike the other games there is no certain user profile. Anyone who likes to challenge themself can download and play our game.<br> 
f. Background:<br> 
There are lots of puzzle games in the market. Unlike the other puzzle games that contain only one category to play, our game will have different categories for each skill. It will also contain repeatable scenarios like typing test, tap frequency, visual memory, word retrieval. In this way, even if players have completed the game, they still will have something to improve themselves.<br><br>

<h2 class="w3-wide">4. PROCESS MODEL</h2><br>
	We chose iterative model for this project. Iterative model is based on designing and implementing a part of the software roughly to clarify it later. Each iteration improves the software and specifies how will the final result be. Since our project is a game, main requirements should be defined clearly but some details might evolve with time. So that iterative model was the best process model for us.<br><br>

<h2 class="w3-wide">5.SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</h2>

<p class="w3-justify">A. Functional Requirements<br>
- Includes an intellectual scenario with multiple levels.<br>
- Levels will be sorted from easy to hard in intellectual scenario.<br>
- Includes repeatable scenarios like typing test, tapping test, word memory, visual memory.<br>
- A timer will count the time spent in the level.<br>
- When the given time is up, the level will end.<br>
- A certain amount of time will be given for each level.<br>
- Players will get a score when they complete the level.<br>
- The score can be a time value or a specific point.<br>
- There will be an interface to display Google Play Game Services.<br>
- Sign in will be automatic.<br>
- There will be user achievements to promote the player to play the game more.<br>
- Leaderboards will show the global score.<br>
- Cloud save will allow to play the game with different accounts.<br><br>

B. Non-functional Requirements<br>
1) Performance<br>
We will build the game in Unity, which is one of the best 2D game engines. Our game will be optimized for scripts, garbage collector and graphic rendering after building the raw game. These conditions will provide high performance for our users.<br>

2) Scalability<br>
Our game will be accesible for all Play Store users. There is no user limitation to play the game, so scalability of the system will be high.<br>

3) Security<br>
The other main goal of our game is protecting user data. So user's progress will be automatically saved in both local device and cloud. Cloud save will allow to load the player's progress when needed in particular cases such as re-installation, device issues etc.<br>

4) Maintainability<br>
Our game runs on mobile and tablet side. This system will be written in Unity with Android SDK tools and C#. The game will always updated and debugged according to the user's feedback and other new features.<br>

5) Usability<br>
Our game will be easy for user. The soft graphics and the specified color palette will be designed for not exhaust the user's eyes. A simple game menu (which will support multi-languages) and detailed walkthrough will make it easier for the user to understand game mechanics.<br>

6) Availability<br>
Our game will be available for more than 12000 different devices that supports android 4.0 or higher. Users don't have to connect to internet to play the game. Their in-game progress will be loaded in their google accounts when they connect the internet.</p><br><br>

<h2 class="w3-wide">7. Conclusion</h2>
	As a conclusion, our project is a mobile game with different categories. Each category can push the limits of different parts of the user's brain. Beyond that, 	Try Hard is a game that every user can enjoy. We had eight weeks to complete this project so we choose specific model for finish the task. As our model requires each week we increased our progress and tried to complete all elements in requirement lists. In addition, game design can require change sometimes in development progress. While we were developing we also changed the parts which we did not like. As a result of that we obtained a game which can be improvable and interactable.
a. Outstanding Issues
	- Google Play connection: Sometimes there is a minor latency about showing 	users current score in statistics section because of the connection. 
b. Possible Abusement of System
     	-  In some levels users can memorize correct answers and can raise his 	position in the leaderboard.
